Virtual Scheduler

In its essence, technology was made to streamline work  ows and to improve time management. However, with how modern technology and businesses are run, it has become increasingly dif  cult to avoid drowning in day-to-day tasks, without having the opportunity to have your daily schedule laid out for you. This is where Virtual Scheduler comes in. Using a clean UI and voice recognition, we can allow Microsoft Hololens to display a virtual time table for each person based on their own individual needs.

Currently, we have one demo available for doctors in hospitals. As hectic and cluttered as hospitals are, we created a simple schedule explorer that will   oat in the doctor’s peripheral vision. This does not add additional items to the doctor’s day, but rather simpli  es and helps better organize their day. It outlines the names and times of each appointment in a list down the side. Additionally, the doctor can then dictate some simple commands to bring up relevant information about the patient, their appointment and other content relevant to the individual. We strongly believe that our product will enhance the experience within hospitals and will organize the doctor’s work  ow.

Our next steps for this solution are to bring in more content-aware information to be used at the doctor’s disposal. If we can eliminate some of the clipboards and   ying sheets that are too common in many hospitals, then we have accomplished our mission. Currently, we have a list of names and information that the doctor can enter either at the beginning of the day or at the end of their day. We are currently developing a website in which the secretary or nurse will enter information then have it translated in real time to the Hololens, so that the doctor will know what is happening as soon as it happens. Additionally, the product of obtaining information and updates from the patient will be improved. The patient’s family can instantly update any issues and changes with their health using the web client, from which the information is instantly “scraped”. Finally, all of the patient’s data will be stored on a local database, so that the input does not have to be consistently updated.

Additionally, with the power of the Hololens, individuals can bring up relevant content that will help with the diagnosis and will keep the doctors current with what has happened. Take for example a patient who has a fracture in their knee. Using Hololens, we can render 3D images for the fracture, then place this fracture on the side where the doctor can then rotate, zoom, and   nally dismiss the hologram. This eliminates the mess and the need to bring X-Ray images, thus saving paper and creating a cleaner work  ow in the hospital.

Outside of the hospital, there are numerous applications for a virtual planner. For important individuals like yourselves, the busy and cluttered time tables are one of the biggest problems that society, as a whole, faces. With our software, we can completely virtualize schedules for individuals to see in their peripheral view at all times. Eventually, the individual would be able to personalize, change, adjust and delete events from their timetable all from the Hololens and our application’s interface.

Virtual Scheduler has numerous applications that bene  t society as a whole. By simplifying daily schedules for the busiest of people, those who need access to important documents and   les get access to them seamlessly. If all the time saved from reorganizing
schedules and brie  ngs can be used to help one more patient in a hospital environment, then that one additional patient is helped. Although the statement above is seemingly redundant, the combined time has a tremendous effect on the well-being and organization of hospitals, and businesses alike. Time is a scarce resource often taken for granted. Using this product, time will be saved where it matters most: in hospital environments where the lives of loved ones are at risk.
